# Mash Runner (with C++)
This is a Repository for Mash Runner, a Game Project from Cobra Code's Udemy course.

As an exercise to improve my C++ in Unreal Engine, this project is done using C++ rather than only Blueprints.

In addition, as an exercise to improve my Game Programmering skills, this project includes:
* Refactorings: Different code structure and implementation of existing features
* New Features: Additions on top of the initial project to expand the gameplay
